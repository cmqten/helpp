## Documentation: the meeting minutes

Objectives: Assign user stories to either individuals or pairs of people depending on the level of difficulty of each job. 

Overview: This sprint we focused on assigning jobs from the three main themes across the app, Data Parsing, Location Services and Charities Profiles. In terms of data parsing, we need to figure out who would be setting up our database structure then parse the charities' registered information from the Canada Revenue website in order to start populating Firebase. The user stories pertaining to those stories was assigned to Carl and Gary. For locations services, we need to figure out how to essentially use the Google Maps and Google Places API within an Android application. The user stories pertaining to that was assigned to Jonathan and Kenny. Both these themes had a large number of user stories within them and which we figured would be better suited for two people. The remain user stories focused on acquiring more information regarding each individual charities. We needed to find, if available, each charity's logo, summary, website, the donation page and social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube) URLs. The remaining three members, Edmond, Shuprio and Max, were assigned the job of findings links.
