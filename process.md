## Decisions/Orginization
To keep ourselves organized we made a group on Facebook messenger and slack to make sure we could stay in contact mutiple ways.
We have been making decisions by everyone giving their opnions and voting on ideas. We have even done polls on messenger if we couldn't decide on something.

## Prioritizing user stories

## Communication/meetings
Our group mainly communicated through Facebook messenger on when we could meet up, and what everyone would be responsible for. 
We tried to meet up once a week to discuss where everyone was on the project and if everyone understood what was going on.
We also made sure to update each other the ideas our concerns we had for the project.

## Next phase
For the next phase of this project we will continue communicate through messenger, but maybe meet up in person more often, 
to establish a better workflow. There was a slight micomunication online with writing user stories and the same was written twice. 
If we were to meet up a bit more maybe we could avoid this in the future. Also, we should make a schedule for each of us to make sure we meet deadlines for future sprints.
